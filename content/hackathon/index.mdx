## Hackathon Update

For the 2024 Solana AI Hackathon created by SendAI, we submitted to the "Agent Infra" and "DeFi Agents" tracks with our core service APIs and a web frontend to interact with our AI powered Solana marketplace oriented services.  
Users are able to sign on with Photon wallet and explore the following features:
- Natural language prompting with special commands for interacting with our APIs
- Retrieve market data for Solana tokens
- Track whale purchases and behaviors for a token of interest ($TETSUO only for the demo)
- Analyze sentiment about TETSUO on market sites such as CoinMarketCap, Dextools, GeckoTerminal, and GMGN.ai
- Sentiment tracking of specified Twitter posts
- Summary and Sentiment of arbitrary web pages or text which will power news feed generation in later editions
- Meme image generation and animation
- Our KenSub video clipper which can summarize and generate shareable clips of longer video content

Through these features, we demonstrate our expanding set of APIs in a responsive web app and an initial browser plugin implementation.
The vision is much greater than these features, however. We have a full swarm capable agent infrastructure inside our core service layer waiting to be activated to chain our APIs together into higher level actions. 
In the near future you will be able to set trigger alerts that can combine market data analysis or whale monitoring, and in later releases we will support full automated transactions using this subsystem.  

Furthermore, our vision is to also provide a bridge for other APIs into our infrastructure as well as offer these capabilities through our APIs to third-parties. 
We already have applications besides our web application that are leveraging our API set such as our discord bots where we prototype and test features, as well as the upcoming Tetsuo AI 3D interactive agent.


## Next steps

We will have a public video demo when the contest gets judged around January 10th and plan to do an AMA so we can talk about our experience and where things are timeline wise. 
We will also have a 1-2 page brochure laying out the different products/projects we are working on so we have an outline for the public to discuss when asking us questions during the AMA. 

Happy new year to the Solana AI community!
